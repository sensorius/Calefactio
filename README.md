# Calefactio
A project to optimize a Nibe heatpump using weather forecasts and green electricity.
The aim of Calefactio is to learn how to program an ESP32 microcontroller which then will be used to interface and to optimize a Nibe heatpump.

Small projects with a limted scope of complexity are created to learn how to program an ESP32. Areas of interest are:

* How to read data from a NTC temperature sensor (Nibe heatpump temperature sensors)
* How to parse a website (Online Weather forecast service, online Electric energy price forecast service) 
* How to implement a webserver (Data Visualization)


Project objectives:

Use an ESP32 as a sensor proxy to override temperature measurements taken by the heatpump.
