# Calefactio
A project to optimize a Nibe heatpump using weather forecasts and green electricity.
The aim of Calefactio is to learn how to program an ESP32 microcontroller which then will be used to interface and to optimize a Nibe heatpump.

Self-contained projects are created to solve specific tasks of building interfaces to different technological areas. Areas of interest are:

* Nibe heatpump temperature sensors
* Online Weather forecast service
* Online Electric energy price forecast service* 
* Data Visualization


Project objectives:

Use an ESP32 as a sensor proxy to override temperature measurements taken by the heatpump.
